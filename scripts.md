## RECCAP2-Ocean code sharing instructions

We have provided a repository for code sharing on GitHub: [https://github.com/RECCAP2-ocean/R2-scripts](https://github.com/RECCAP2-ocean/R2-scripts).
The idea is that general code that might be useful between chapters is shared. For example, loading data, calculating fluxes, comparing with SOCAT *p*CO<sub>2</sub>, etc. Currently, we have code for `Python` and `R`, and are eagerly awaiting contributions for other languages. 

### Contributing
To contribute to this repository you will need to be slightly familiar with `git`. Here are the steps.

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the repository using GitHub's forking function. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account that you can edit freely - no changes will affect the RECCAP2-ocean scripts. In my case, the forked repo will live at [https://github.com/lukegre/R2-scripts](https://github.com/lukegre/R2-scripts). I will use this as the example from now. 
2.  You can add your files in GitHub by browsing your forked repository or using the `git` interface if you're familiar with the command line interface. Make the changes to the `main` branch - this is the easiest for the following steps. Please comment your files so that others can understand what you're doing. 
3. Go to the home of the forked repository (*e.g.* [https://github.com/lukegre/R2-scripts](https://github.com/lukegre/R2-scripts)) and you should see a banner above the file list that says `Contribute`. Click and select `create pull request`. Follow the instructions and finish the pull request. 
4. Drop us an email to let us know that you've added some code ([luke.gregor@usys.ethz.ch](mailto:luke.gregor@usys.ethz.ch) OR [jensdaniel.mueller@usys.ethz.ch](mailto:jensdaniel.mueller@usys.ethz.ch)) as this will require approval by one of the administrators. 

Happy coding :)
